## Electricity generation in the United States

Recently, the United States' electricity generation has been a changing landscape, as renewables have become more economically viable and more popular with an increased interest in climate change. 

__Overview:__ The premise of the following report is to better understand the US electricity generation over the span of a 5-year period (2014-2018) in the context of renewable energy. The report then includes a case study of wind energy in Texas and considers the feasibility of reaching 100% renewable energy. 

__Data:__ The data used in this analysis comes the United States Energy Information Administration's  [Form EIA-860](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/) and their [Balancing Authority's Hourly Electric Grid Monitor](https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/gridmonitor/dashboard/electric_overview/balancing_authority/ERCO). The EIA-860 form contains granular data regarding exisiting and planned generators and power plants with 1 megawatt or greater of combined nameplate capacity. The Hourly Grid Monitor data I used is for Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCO). To better understand Texas demand load and wind generation, I used [Hourly Aggregated Wind Output](http://www.ercot.com/gridinfo/generation) data and the [ERCOT Hourly Load Data](http://www.ercot.com/gridinfo/load/load_hist) from the ERCO website. 

__Goal:__ To capture the United States' current electricity mix and to visualize the challenges and commitments necessary for a renewable future for the state of Texas.

__Key Findings__

* The majority of wind turbines reside in the central area of the United States, which according to [WINDExchange](https://windexchange.energy.gov/maps-data/321) has the potential wind capacity, due to wind speed and direction during this time. 
* Solar and hydroelectric power are found along the two coasts, which makes sense as ocean and sun are flow resources abundant in these areas. 
* Natural gas appears to be prevalent throughout the United States and has been called [a transition fuel](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-gas-in-todays-energy-transitions) that acts as an alternative to polluting fossil fuels. However, there is [controversy](https://www.greenamerica.org/fight-dirty-energy/amazon-build-cleaner-cloud/natural-gas-transition-fuel-myth) regarding the beneficial environmental impacts of natural gas. 
* Coal, oil, and nuclear are mostly located in the Midwest and along the East Coast. The Pacific Northwest has aggressive renewable energy portfolio standards that force states like California to remove and retire their emissions-heavy fossil fuel resources. 

Despite the dominant fossil fuels in the US electricity mix, renewable sources such as wind and solar have been steadily growing during recent years. Although hydroelectric power is a renewable resource, the best sites for hydroelectric dams have already been built and taken advantage of. Therefore, most renewable efforts focus on solar and wind. 

_The figure below demonstrates the growth in renewable energy from 2014 to 2018. Note wind capacity increase in Texas._

__Key Findings__

* From 2014 to 2018, natural gas has increased from a little more than 45% to nearly 50% of the United States electricity mix. [Hydraulic fracking](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=26112) has allowed for natural gas to be a cheap and abundant energy resource. 
* As a result of [natural gas plants increasing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/climate/natural-gas-renewables-fight.html), coal has been steadily decreasing its proportion of the US generation. Coal plants that were built in the 1970s have been decommissioned. 
* Although it appears to be only a small percentage of the US electricity mix, do not lose hope! Wind and solar have both increased during the 5-year time period. Solar is close to surpassing oil, and wind is close to surpassing nuclear power and hydropower.

  )
```

__Key Findings__

* Although the change in solar appears to be minor in the context of the entire energy mix, when considering the installed-capacity of solar alone, it has more than doubled in its installed capacity in the last 5 years. 
* Wind has also been growing approximately 125% of its installed capacity over the last 5 years. 
* Natural gas, hydropower, oil, and nuclear have made very minor changes over the last 5 years. To understand overall trends, these plants will need to be studied on a long-term basis, in order to see the frequency of decommissioning. 
* Coal has decreased by approximately 30% from 2014 to 2018, demonstrating that although coal plants are retiring, it does not seem like they are being rebuilt.

__Key Findings__

* Compared to the United States electricity's mix, Texas has a higher proportion of natural gas and wind. Both are dominant industries in Texas, and we are focusing this report on wind. 
* In every other fuel type, Texas is below the national proportion, especially for coal (a good thing!), nuclear (also good, depending on who you're talking to), and hydroelectric power (understandable given the site-specific constraints of this resource)

  )
```

__Key Finding__

* Electricity demand fluctuates throughout the year, by time of day and by season. The demand is highest during the summer months, and lowest during the spring. For sunny states like California and Texas, this is typical, as summer months increase usage of AC which increase electricity demand and winter months require heating. 


### Current Texas Wind

Recently, Texas has been receiving attention for its [wind energy](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/us/texas-wind-energy-trnd/index.html). In fact, according to [Wind Energy International](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/10/18/texas-wind-energy-so-strong-its-beating-out-coal-power/3865995002/), if Texas was its own country, it would be the fifth-largest wind energy producer in the world!

_What does wind look like as a resource?_

```{r}
gen_plants_texas_wind <-
  gen_plants %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  filter(
    fuel %in% "Wind",
    year == "2018"
  ) %>%
  mutate(texas = if_else(state == "TX", TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  group_by(texas) %>%
  summarise(capacity = sum(capacity)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  summarise(percent_tx = last(capacity) / first(capacity))

gen_plants_texas_wind %>%
  pull(percent_tx)
```

Currently, __`r round(pull(gen_plants_texas_wind, percent_tx), 2) * 100`%__ of the United States' wind energy generation occurs in Texas. 

```{r fig.align = "center"}
texas_load_wind %>%
  count(date, wt = wind) %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, n)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::label_number(scale = 0.000001,  suffix = "M")
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Wind generation - ERCOT 8760 hour profile (2019)",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Wind Generation (MW)",
    caption = "Source: Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)"
  )
```

__Key Finding__

* Luckily, wind in Texas is present during the entire year, which is why it's such an attractive resource, as utilities can depend on generation during all seasons. Other resources such as solar will have less production during the Winter months compared to the Summer months. 

Shown in figure _Demand Load - ERCOT 8760 hour profile (2019)_, we can see that the peak demand load is around August. Below, we analyze what a single day in August looks like. 

```{r fig.align = "center"}

  ) +

    x = "Hour",
    y = "Wind Generation (MW)",
    caption = "Source: Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)"
  )
```

__Key Findings__

* As expected, demand from midnight to 7am appear to be quite low, while the highest demand peaks in the evening, as people are coming home from work. 
* However, as demonstrated above, the wind generation is highest at night (when demand is lowest) but lowest during the day (when demand is highest). This structure makes wind complementary to solar but presents a challenge of meeting energy demand during the peaking times.

_... Even with such a huge wind presence, we would need to further increase wind capacity in order to meet sustainable goals._

With the urgency of climate change, some individuals are advocating for utilties [to go 100% renewable](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/9/14/17853884/utilities-renewable-energy-100-percent-public-opinion). Being 100% renewable means providing energy from renewable resources like the sun, wind, hydroelectric power, instead of fossil fuels. One challenge with renewables is that their power is their variability. Utilities need to plan for these changes in generation throughout the day and the year. Even for states who are leaders in the renewable energy front, 100% renewable energy is a daunting task. So how can we achieve this?

Through our analysis, we will determine what going 100% renewable means to [Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)](http://www.ercot.com/about) for the state of Texas, specifically in the context of wind.

Often times, utilities will be working with 8760-hour data, which means a years worth of data broken down by the hour. These hourly data are typically for demand (how much electricity we are using!) and generation (how much electricity is being supplied by generation from power plants). Utilities need to decide, hour by hour, which fuel generation sources will be supplying the power needed to satisfy the power demand. 

### Transitioning to 100% Renewable Energy

[The Solutions Project](https://thesolutionsproject.org/) is an organization that creates roadmaps to lead countries, cities, and states to 100% renewable energy. Through analysis, they have  determined that the ideal renewable energy mix for Texas includes 63.9% of [wind](https://thesolutionsproject.org/infographic/#tx) by 2050.

    name = "Case",
    labels = c("Current 2019 Data", "100% Renewable Energy Scenario")
  ) +

  labs(
    title = "Projected Wind Generation in Texas - 100% Renewable Scenario",
    caption = "Source: Electricity Reliability Council of Texas",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Time"
  )


```

__Key Findings__

* As demonstrated from the plot above, wind generation will need to dramatically increase in order to rise from about 20% of the current 2019 energy mix to above 60% of the energy mix. As mentioned before, Texas is _already_ a leader in wind energy in the United States.
* The graph above assumes that the wind capacity at a given time is fixed, but in an ideal scenario, wind efficiency can be optimized. 


```{r}

old_capacity <- 
  texas_wind_projected %>%
  summarise(capacity = max(wind_capacity_MW)) %>%
  pull()

new_capacity <-
  texas_wind_projected %>%
  mutate(
    wind_output_percent = wind_output_percent_installed / 100,
    new_capacity = mwh_renewable_wind / wind_output_percent
  ) %>%
  summarise(capacity = max(new_capacity)) %>%
  pull()
```

ERCOT currently has __`r round(old_capacity / 10^3, 2)`GW__ of wind energy, and ERCOT would need to install __`r round(((new_capacity - old_capacity) / (10^3)), 2)`GW__ in order to have 100% renewable energy, as recommended by The Solutions Project. The reason that this value is so high is that, as seen in previous graphs, the time of highest demand appears to have low wind generation. Realistically, a 63% wind electricity mix does not mean wind needs to provide 63% of the demand at every hour- it simply needs to provide 63% overall. Balancing Authorities have the capacity to optimize for which fuel source should be used, and therefore, it is likely that the actual needed installed capacity is much lower to reach 100% renewable energy.

While this report does not present an economic analysis to account for feasibility of installation, it's important to note that this final value is an actual numeric value to account for all demand throughout the year in Texas. Research for this project showed a gap in roadmap planning for renewable energy: that current planning documents only included vague numbers for percentage breakdown of renewable energy but did not include a concrete number of how much renewable energy needs to be installed in order to attain this goal. 

In order to reach 100% renewable energy, we must create clear roadmaps and actionable goals to reach.
